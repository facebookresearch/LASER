## Docker

A docker image has been created to help you with the settings of an environment. Here are the steps to follow:

* Open a command prompt in the root of your LASER project
* Execute the command `docker build --tag=laser docker`
* Once the image is built run `docker run -it laser`

A REST server on top of the embed task is under developement,
to run it you'll have to expose a local port [CHANGEME_LOCAL_PORT] by executing the next line instead of the last command. It'll override the command line entrypoint of your docker container.

* `docker run -p [CHANGEME_LOCAL_PORT]:80 -it laser python app.py`

This Flask server will serve a REST Api that can be use by calling your server with this URL :

*   http://127.0.0.1:[CHANGEME_LOCAL_PORT]/vectorize?q=[YOUR_SENTENCE_URL_ENCODED]&lang=[LANGUAGE]

Here is an example of how you can send requests to it with python:

```python
import requests
import numpy as np
url = "http://127.0.0.1:[CHANGEME_LOCAL_PORT]/vectorize"
params = {"q": "Hey, how are you?\nI'm OK and you?", "lang": "en"}
resp = requests.get(url=url, params=params).json()
print(resp["embedding"])
```
